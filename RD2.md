One of the challenges I encountered was figuring out how to set the inscribed while loops. Another challenge was
figuring out what type of test cases to use.
We followed the 3 rules of programming by first understanding the problem, thinking about how to solve it, then 
writing out the algorithm. While writing the algorithm we thought about test cases to help us finish. We then wrote the 
code and tested it until it worked the way we wanted.
We worked together to plan the best way to write the while loops and ultimately it worked. The test cases were tough 
but after visualizing how the code would work it all worked out
One of the key takeaways were how to use a while loop in a while loop. Another was practice with error checking
I think I did learn what was supposed to be learned after looking at the purpose in the README. 
Working with Hazel was good. She is very smart and helped me better understand the problem and a better way to use 
the inscribed while loop.
